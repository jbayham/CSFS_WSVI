## Introduction

In 2020, our research team at Colorado State University developed the [Wildfire Social Vulnerability Index](https://jbayham.github.io/CSFS_WSVI/report.html) (WFSVI) in order to set a criteria for reduced match for the Forest Restoration & Wildfire Risk Mitigation (FRWRM) Grant. This report describes updates to the WFSVI including updated data, alignment with the federal [Justice 40](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/#3/33.47/-97.5) initiative, and further analysis of the WFSVI and reduced match criteria. 

## American Community Survey Update

Using the tidy-census package, we download the data directly from the [American Community Survey](https://data.census.gov/) (ACS) in the script named 01_get_data. Previously, data was downloaded from [Safegraph](https://www.safegraph.com/free-data/open-census-data). In script 01_get_data, we download data for the Census Block Group (CBG) and census tract. We then calculate the respective variables for both geographies. The census tract values will fill in any missing block group values.

We also added another script, 07_monte_carlo_simulation.R, which generates data using the estimates and margin of errors from ACS data. It then records the times each CBG qualifies per a given number of iterations. Estimates from ACS are used as means, and the margins of errors are used to calculate the standard deviation. We assume that the ACS data is normally distributed. Given the data distribution, the simulation process identifies CBGs that have qualified but otherwise would be less likely to qualify or vice versa.

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted trends and affected the ability to generate data due to sampling challenges. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that, Due to the difficulties of fielding a household survey during the COVID-19 pandemic, household nonresponse increased substantially in the American Community Survey, with evidence of increased nonresponse bias in many statistics. These inaccuracies and high margins of errors may cause some CBGs to qualify even though they shouldn’t or not qualify when they should. It may take some time before the full impact of the pandemic on census data accuracy is fully understood. 

## Justice 40

[Executive Order 14008](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/02/01/2021-02177/tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad#:~:text=Sec.%20223.%20Justice40,40-percent%20goal.) directed the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to develop the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST). This tool uses data to analyze burdens across eight categories: climate change, energy, health, housing, legacy pollution, transportation, water and wastewater, and workforce development. The primary purpose of the CEJST is to aid federal agencies in identifying disadvantaged communities that would benefit from the programs offered under the Justice40 Initiative. While the Colorado State Forest Service is not a federal agency, the goal of the CEJST is aligned with the intent of HB 20-1057, which established the reduced match criteria.

We collect data from the [Council on Environmental Quality](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/downloads). The WFSVI is constructed at the Census Block Group (CBG), while the CEJST is constructed at the Census Tract (comprised of CBGs). The CEJST contains a binary indicator for every Census Tract that determines whether it is considered "disadvantaged." We consider any disadvantaged Census Tract to qualify for reduced match. 

## Comparison Map

This section presents a map to compare the original WFSVI (2020) to the updated version (2023).
